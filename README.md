# 🎯 DSA Repository  

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This space is primarily a **reference guide**—to quickly revisit problems, patterns, and concepts in DSA.  
Each topic/problem is documented in a consistent format for clarity and easy recall.  

---

## 🎁 Purpose  

The repository is not just for solving problems but for **structured revisits**.  
For every DSA concept or pattern, I’ll maintain a standard template to capture:  

### 🏟️ Where to Use?  
- Explains the scenarios and problem types where this concept/pattern is applied.  

### ⏳ Time / Space Complexity  
- Notes on efficiency for quick comparison during practice or interviews.  

### 🛣️ Approach  
- Step-by-step breakdown of the logic or algorithm used.  

### 🗒️ Notes  
- Extra pointers, edge cases, or optimizations worth remembering.  

### ❕ Sample  
```java
// Example solution with inline comments
```
